# belly-button-challenge


This challenge required the building of an interactive dashboard that would populate a number of graphs illustrating the diversity of microorganisms residing in the belly button of the selected test subject. The test subject is chosen using a dropdown menu of samples in the dataset. Once the subject is chosen, the metadata for that subject is used to populate a panel-box with the demographic information for that subject. There are two graphs on the dashboard, as follows:

Bar chart of the top ten bacteria cultures, referred to as operational taxonomic units (OTU).
Buble chart  of each sample.

Resources used for this include: Multiple sources were referenced, including official Bootcamp course materials, instructor-led classes and shared resources, Google Search, StackOverflow, as well as support and guidance from Xpert Learning Assistant and ChatGPT.
