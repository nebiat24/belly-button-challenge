# belly-button-challenge

# Introduction
This challenge required the building of an interactive dashboard that would populate a number of graphs illustrating the diversity of microorganisms residing in the belly button of the selected test subject. The test subject is chosen using a dropdown menu of samples in the dataset. Once the subject is chosen, the metadata for that subject is used to populate a panel-box with the demographic information for that subject. There are three graphs on the dashboard, as follows:

Bar chart of the top ten microbial species, referred to as operational taxonomic units (OTU).
Scatterplot of the microbial samples collected.
Indicator gauge that illustrates the washing frequency for the selected test subject.
